# Level 6 : Selfie

A governance, something really nice to learn in the decentralized space.. but this one is not fully secure.

Target is clear : we have to drain funds ðŸ˜Š

First thing that should jump on your eyes when reading contracts should be the function `drainAllFunds(address receiver)` , unfortunally it can only be executed by someone from the gouvernance â€¦ but we keep this function in mind when reading the other contract.

On the SimpleGovernance contract there is a lot of code useless for our understanding, the only things to note is that to be part of the gouvernance we have to pass the _hasEnoughVotes() function by having more than half of the total supply (maybe using a flashLoan could help for that ðŸ˜›).

Then when part of the gouv, we can execute action .. interesting. To do that we can use the `queueAction()` function that takes bytes data representing a call to a function to execute after 2 days of patience (but with EVM 2 days is short we learned that on the last challenge ). This function will generate an actionId that can be submit to`executeAction(actionId)`

Here a short recap to hack it : 

1. Flash loan all the DVT available on the pool
2. Trigger aÂ **`snapshot`**Â on theÂ **`DamnValuableTokenSnapshot`**Â contract to be part of the gouvernance
3. CallÂ **`queueAction`**Â onÂ **`SimpleGovernance`**Â contract to create an action to callÂ **`drainAllFunds`**Â on the pool
4. Return the DVT we have borrowed from the pool
5. Wait two days and callÂ **`executeAction`**Â on the Governance contract

## Key Security Takeaways

- Using public audited contract from OpenZeppelin for Gouvernance can be good
    - [https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/)
- On-chain governance is hard, maybe using another contract to drain the funds to a trusted address can help
